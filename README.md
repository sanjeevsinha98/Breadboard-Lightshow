# Breadboard-Lightshow
This code utilizes the Arduino Uno board to control LEDs based on different sounds, and has two different modes using a button input. One mode uses different LED colors to display the loudness (amplitude of the sound input) which is typically used with music, and the other mode uses sound input, such as a clap, to change the patterns of the LEDs.
