# Breadboard-Lightshow
This code utilizes the Arduino Uno board to control LEDs based on different sounds, and has two different modes using a button input. One mode uses music input to display the loudness of the music itself by lighting up LEDs of different colors, and the other mode changes the patterns of LEDs by any sound given, such as a clap.
